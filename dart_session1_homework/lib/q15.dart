// Question 15
// What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
// impact the way variables are used?

//Answer
//This means that each varialbe has specific type from the beginning, and this reduces
//errors during programing.

//This makes dart code safer,clearer and reliable, because variables can't suddenly
//change their identity through program.
