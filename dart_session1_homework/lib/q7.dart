// Question 7
// Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur: ```dart void main()
// { String name = "Alice"; name = 123; print(name); } ```

//Answer
//Error: You can't assign integer to String varialbe

//The variable name is declared as type String, so it can only store text.
//Dart is statically typed, so varialbe types can't change after declaration.
